# Resume-Matic-Intelligent-CV-Categorizer-and-Structured-Data-Extractor

## Overview

This project implements an automated system to classify resumes into different job categories (such as Data Scientist, Java Developer, Advocate, etc.) and extract key information like skills, experiences, and education. Using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques including TF-IDF vectorization and machine learning models, the system transforms raw resume text into meaningful numerical features to enable accurate classification and data extraction.

## Features

- **Resume Parsing:** Extracts relevant fields such as skills, job titles, education, and experience from resumes.
- **Text Vectorization:** Uses TF-IDF vectorization to convert resume text into numerical features based on word relevance.
- **Classification:** Applies machine learning algorithms (e.g., K-Nearest Neighbors) to categorize resumes into predefined job roles.
- **Flexible and Extensible:** Modular code allows easy integration of additional NLP models or classification algorithms.
- **Supports Varied Formats:** Designed to handle different resume layouts, though variability can sometimes impact extraction accuracy.
